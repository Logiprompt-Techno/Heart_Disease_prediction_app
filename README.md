# Heart_Disease_prediction_app

**Abstract**

HeartSense AI is a machine learning–based web application that predicts the risk of heart disease using patient health data. The system is built using a Random Forest Classifier, which is trained on key medical features such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol, heart rate, chest pain type, and exercise-induced angina. The trained model is deployed in a Flask backend, and a simple web interface allows users to input patient details and instantly receive a risk prediction along with a probability score indicating whether the patient is at low, moderate, or high risk. This project demonstrates how AI-driven predictive analytics can support early detection and assist doctors in making informed clinical decisions, while also showing how machine learning models can be integrated into real-world healthcare systems.
